    <h2 class="section-title">Introduction & Background</h2>
    <p>This proposal intends to formulate a brand-new approach to solving a problem for all technologies we currently possess in modern times. According to Hellekalek and Peter, technology still lacks more awareness and solutions to create true random seeds for random number generators in computing. A computer can create pseudo-randomness, which is performed with mathematical functions, but it can’t create real randomness without the use of a true random seed (Stipčević et al.).</p>
    <p>Some have tried to answer this problem with the use of static noise, such as Alan Turing, others capture atmospheric noise to create random seeds, other algorithms use the pointing direction of the mouse, etc. The problem is that these techniques are either too complicated to explain or verify, and they also have a heavy human interaction factor which cannot guarantee a flawless execution. With the emergence of quantum computing, complicated mathematical functions that were once thought almost impossible to calculate are now reachable. This is an attempt to think outside the box and propose a new approach to randomness in computing with the help of biology and genetics.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Problem Formulation Model</h2>
    <h3>Need Statement</h3>
    <p>Computers are responsible for handling our data, and all this data gets encrypted using very complex mathematical formulas and concepts. With the emergence of quantum computing and algorithms such as Shor’s algorithm, encryption that relies solely on mathematical functions could be decrypted in the coming years (Stipčević and Koç 280). One of the most difficult tasks for a computer is the concept of randomness (Bahrami et al.).</p>

    <h3>Goal Statement</h3>
    <p>This proposal intends to blend biology and computers to create secure methods that are hard to manipulate by humans and hard to predict even by more advanced computers. There are other methods to obtain random seeds, and this question has challenged other mathematicians and scientists such as Alan Turing and Emil Borel (Sun).</p>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>We aim to create an original experiment using colored eggs produced by Eastern Eggers chickens as the entropy source. These chickens produce a variety of colored eggs in different quantities (Lukanov et al.). This natural variation is harder for humans to manipulate, and while simple, it provides a profound source of entropy that is easy to explain, verify, and hard to predict.</p>

    <h3>Constraints</h3>
    <p>Can we have a simple way to generate randomness for computing with minimal to no human interaction in the process?</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Stakeholder Analysis</h2>
    <p>Potential Stakeholders:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cybersecurity Professionals & Cryptographers</strong><br>
        Interest: Secure encryption methods immune to quantum attacks.<br>
        Relationship: Depend on strong random number generation.<br>
        Gains: More secure seed generation methods.</li>
      <li><strong>Computer Scientists & Mathematicians</strong><br>
        Interest: Exploring novel entropy sources for randomness.<br>
        Relationship: Study randomness and algorithmic security.<br>
        Gains: A novel source of entropy that may inspire new models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Plan for Response</h2>
    <p>We will create a technical report and demonstration program that documents our process, findings, and results using chicken egg patterns as entropy for randomness generation.</p>

    <h3>Genre & Medium</h3>
    <p>Demonstration Program: A simple C program for validation<br>
    Multimodal Elements: Explanatory visuals and report<br>
    Stakeholder Fit: Accessible to technical and general audiences</p>

    <h3>Implementation Plan</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Collection</strong> – Led by Manuel</li>
      <li><strong>Data Compilation</strong> – Led by Abrar</li>
      <li><strong>Algorithm Development</strong> – Led by Adnan</li>
      <li><strong>C Program Implementation</strong> – Led by Manuel</li>
      <li><strong>Research & Documentation</strong> – Led by Adrien</li>
      <li><strong>Final Review & Presentation</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our goal is to provide a novel, verifiable method for generating true randomness for use in secure computing systems.</p>
